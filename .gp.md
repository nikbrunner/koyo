# Kōyō Project Context

## Project Overview
Kōyō is a keyboard configuration project focusing on QMK firmware for both Moonlander and Corne (crkbd) keyboards. The name (紅葉) refers to autumn leaves in Japanese, reflecting the project's aesthetic and design philosophy.


## Base Instructions for GPT

### Primary Directives
1. Ask for specific files or code snippets when needed for context
2. Request clarification when requirements are unclear
3. Think step-by-step through complex problems
4. Admit uncertainty rather than make assumptions
5. Use established project patterns when suggesting solutions

### When You Need Information
Always ask for:
1. Specific file contents when modifying existing code
2. Current implementation when suggesting changes
3. Clarification about project context when unsure
4. Confirmation before suggesting major changes

### How to Ask
Use clear, specific requests like:
- "Could you show me the current content of utils.sh?"
- "To help with this, I need to see how this is currently implemented in {file}"
- "Before proceeding, could you confirm if this follows your current pattern in {similar_file}?"
- "I'm unsure about {specific_aspect}. Could you clarify?"

### Response Pattern
1. Acknowledge the context provided
2. Ask for any missing information
3. Present solution with explanations
4. Offer to clarify or adjust as needed

### Code Style Preferences
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use consistent error handling
- Maintain existing logging patterns
- Keep scripts focused and modular

### Remember
- The project uses specific logging functions (debug_log, success_log, etc.)
- Config values should be accessed through get_config
- Scripts should support --dry-run where applicable
- Error handling should be consistent and clear

## Key Project Files
- `config.yml`: Central configuration file containing paths and keyboard-specific settings
- `utils.sh`: Common utilities for logging and config reading
- `setup.sh`: Installation script for dependencies and environment setup
- `update_svg.sh`: Script for generating keyboard layout visualization
- `koyo`: Main CLI tool

## Key Dependencies
- QMK Firmware
- keymap-drawer (for layout visualization)
- yq (for YAML processing)
- ZSH shell

## Important Configuration Details
1. QMK Setup:
   - Uses QMK CLI for firmware management
   - Configures QMK home directory
   - Handles both fresh installations and updates

2. Layout Configuration:
   - Uses keymap-drawer for visualization
   - Supports custom key mappings and combos
   - Maintains consistent layout across keyboards

3. Utility Functions:
   - Logging with colors and icons
   - Config reading with yq
   - Error handling and dry-run support

## Common Tasks
1. Setting up environment:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. Updating layout SVG:
   ```bash
   ./update_svg.sh
   # or
   koyo update svg
   ```

3. Flashing keyboards:
   ```bash
   koyo moonlander flash
   koyo crkbd flash
   ```

## Style Guidelines
1. Script Structure:
   - Use strict mode (`set -e`)
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Support dry-run mode where applicable

2. Logging:
   - Use utility functions: debug_log, success_log, error_log, warning_log
   - Provide clear, actionable feedback
   - Use consistent icons and colors

3. Configuration:
   - Use YAML for configuration files
   - Access config values through get_config utility
   - Support environment-specific overrides

## Common Issues and Solutions
1. QMK Setup:
   - Always configure QMK home directory
   - Run qmk setup for fresh installations
   - Verify dependencies before operations

2. Layout Generation:
   - Handle YAML syntax carefully, especially with special characters
   - Use proper keycode mappings in kd_config.yaml
   - Verify paths before operations

3. Permission Issues:
   - Handle script permissions explicitly
   - Use sudo when needed for system-level operations
   - Check file existence before operations

## Development Guidelines
1. Error Handling:
   - Exit on critical errors
   - Provide helpful error messages
   - Clean up on exit when necessary

2. Configuration:
   - Keep paths in config.yml
   - Use relative paths when possible
   - Support configuration overrides

3. Testing:
   - Support dry-run mode
   - Verify dependencies
   - Check file permissions and existence

## Key Features to Maintain
1. Cross-keyboard compatibility
2. Clear visual layout representation
3. Easy setup and configuration
4. Consistent error handling
5. Clear user feedback
6. Modular design

## Core Code Patterns

### Standard Script Structure
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Get the directory of this script
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Source utilities
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/utils.sh"

# Enable strict mode
set -euo pipefail

# Get repo path from config
KOYO_REPO=$(eval echo "$(get_config '.paths.repo_dir')")
```

### Standard Dependency Check Pattern
```bash
check_dependency() {
    debug_log "Checking dependency installation..."

    if ! command -v dependency &>/dev/null; then
        debug_log "Warning: dependency not found"

        if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == "true" ]]; then
            debug_log "Would prompt to install dependency"
            return
        fi

        prompt_log "Would you like to install dependency now? (y/n)"
        read -r response

        if [[ "$response" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
            # Installation logic here
            success_log "Dependency installed successfully"
        else
            warning_log "Please install dependency manually before continuing"
            exit 1
        fi
    else
        success_log "Dependency found"
    fi
}
```

### Common Config Access Pattern
```yaml
# config.yml
paths:
  qmk_dir: "$HOME/repos/qmk/qmk_firmware"
  repo_dir: "$HOME/repos/nikbrunner/koyo"
```
```bash
# Access in scripts
QMK_DIR=$(eval echo "$(get_config '.paths.qmk_dir')")
```

### Standard Error Handling Pattern
```bash
if ! some_command; then
    error_log "Failed to execute command"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Keymap Layout Pattern
```yaml
# kd_layout.yaml example structure
layout: {qmk_keyboard: crkbd/rev1, qmk_layout: LAYOUT_split_3x5_3}
layers:
  LY_BAS:
  - {t: key, h: hold}  # Standard key with hold function
  - {t: tap, h: hold, s: shifted}  # Key with shift function
```
